# Imhotep, the peaceful builder.

## What is it?
Imhotep is a tool which will comment on commits coming into your
repository and check for syntactic errors and general lint
warnings. 

Imhotep, the first Egyptian architect, is known as "the one who comes
in peace". In keeping with that name, the goal of this tool is to keep
code reviews peaceful and productive by having robots point out the
nitpicky details, leaving people to critique bigger piecture things,
not spacing and misspelling issues.
